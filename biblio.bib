  abstract = {In this classic bestseller---one of the most influential business
	books of all time---innovation expert Clayton Christensen shows how
	even the most outstanding companies can do everything right---yet
	still lose market leadership. Christensen explains why most companies
	miss out on new waves of innovation. No matter the industry, he says,
	a successful company with established products will get pushed aside
	unless managers know how and when to abandon traditional business
	practices. Offering both successes and failures from leading companies
	as a guide, The Innovator's Dilemma gives you a set of rules for
	capitalizing on the phenomenon of disruptive innovation.},
